<h3>Introduction</h3>
This document describes how to install OnSearch.  If the
system already has the features needed by OnSearch
(described in, "<a href="#systemconfig">System
Requirements</a>,") 
then you should be able to install OnSearch by entering 
the following commands.

<blockquote><pre>
  $ su            # Log in as the system administrator.
  Password:
  # perl install  # Follow the prompts.
</pre></blockquote>

The <tt>install</tt> script tells you if the World Wide Web server
is missing a feature, that OnSearch needs.  The section,
"<a href="#apacheconfig">Configuring Apache</a>," describes
the changes to <tt>httpd.conf</tt> that OnSearch needs.
<p>
The section, "<a
href="#autoinstall">Automatic Installation</a>," describes
each step of the automatic installation process in detail.

<a name="systemconfig">
<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<ol>
<li>You must be able to log in as the superuser ("root") or
      set permissions using Web server's user ID.
<p>
<li>The file systems where OnSearch is installed 
      (/usr/local and the Apache
      <tt>DocumentRoot</tt> directory) need to be writable;
      e.g. they are not mounted read-only locally or via a 
      network.  If the system does not have a /usr/local file 
      system, the installation process will create one.
<p>
<li>The system must have sufficient disk space for the
indexes.  They can add significantly to a Web site's storage.
<p>
<li>An Apache Web server, version 1.3 or later.
      If you don't have Apache, you can find it at 
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org</a>.
<p>
      The Web server must have:
      <ol type="a">
       <li>Handlers to Run Common Gateway Interface scripts outside 
      <tt>ScriptAlias</tt> directories.</dd>
      <li>Handlers to execute CGI scripts using Server Side
      Include <tt>shtml</tt> files.</dd>
      <li>The ability to write to the document directories.  
      <li>Unique user and group IDs for the Web
      server in order to index from within OnSearch.
      </ol>
<p>
The section, <a href="apacheconfig">Apache
Configuration</a>, describes how to add these features.
<p>
If these requirements present security problems, you can limit 
<strong>OnSearch</strong> to only a portion of the Web
site, or create a symlink to OnSearch's directories.  The
Apache document <tt>manual/misc/security_tips.xml</tt>
discusses these issues.
<li>Perl, version 5.6.1 or later.  OnSearch can work
      with earlier versions, but its HTML filtering relies on
      the Unicode support of later versions.  See 
      <a href="#perl">Perl Configuration.</a>
      <p>
      If you need to install or upgrade Perl, you can
      find it at: 
      <a href="http://www.perl.org">http://www.perl.org/.</a>
      <p>
      The Perl interpreter, or a symlink to the interpreter,
      must be <tt>/usr/bin/perl.</tt>
      <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> OnSearch does not yet use the 
      Perl I/O abstraction layer.  One symptom of I/O layer
      incompatibility is excessive memory usage.  
      To determine if Perl was built with the abstraction
      layer, and how to cope with it, see 
      <a href="#perl">Perl Configuration.</a>
<p>
<li>A C compiler.  The C part of OnSearch was built 
      with the GNU C compiler, GCC 2.95.  Other ANSI C compilers should
      also be able to build the binary programs with minimal effort.
      The GCC Web site is <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>, 
      but most operating systems offer GCC as an optional
      free software package.
<p>
<li>Web browser(s) that can handle cookies and CSS 2 style
    sheets; e.g., Mozilla and Netscape, versions 5 and later, and recent
    versions of Internet Explorer.  Although OnSearch
    is compatible with earlier browsers and text mode
    programs like <tt>lynx</tt>, the pages are much more readable
    when viewed with recent browsers.  
<p>
<li>To index and search documents other than text files,
      OnSearch's plugins rely on helper applications.  The Postscript
      plugin uses GNU Ghostscript to translate Postscript to text. 
      The PDF plugin uses the <tt>pdftotext</tt> utility.  The gzip plugin
      requires the <tt>gzip</tt> utility.  You can find ghostscript at 
      <a href="http://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost">
      http://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost</a>.  Pdftotext is part 
      of the xpdf distribution which is downloadable from 
      <a href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf">http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf</a>.
      The main gzip site is <a href="http://www.gnu.org">
      http://www.gnu.org</a>.  Many operating systems also provide 
      ghostscript, xpdf, and gzip packages.

<a name="autoinstall">
<h3>Automatic Installation</h3>

If for some reason the automatic installation doesn't work,
refer to "<a href="#manualinstall">Manual Installation</a>."
<p>
The examples here show an Apache server installed
as described in, <a href="#apacheinstall">Apache Installation</a>, and,
<a href="#apacheconfig">Configuring Apache</a>.  The host name,
directories, and user and group names may be different.

<ol>
<li>Log in as the superuser and start the <tt>install</tt> script.
<blockquote><pre>
$ su
Password:
# perl install
</pre></blockquote>
<li>The <tt>install</tt> script will search for the Web
server and its configuration If the system has more than one Web
server the install script will ask which to use.  This step
can take several minutes.

<blockquote><pre>
OnSearch installation.  If this program can't determine the site
configuration, read INSTALL.html.

NOTE: If you've already installed OnSearch, make a backup copy.
Press [Ctrl-C] to exit now if necessary.

The Web server is /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd.  Is this correct (y/n)?
y
The Web server's configuration file is /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf.  
Is this correct (y/n)?
y
Configuring for /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd and /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf.
</pre></blockquote>

<li>The install script finds the settings it needs from the 
      Web server's configuration.
      If you're not certain that the settings are correct, 
      determine that the settings in <tt>httpd.conf</tt> are
      also correct.
      <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> The install script will also
      warn you if the Web server is not configured to handle
      CGI scripts and Server Side Includes.  You must
      make the necessary changes to <tt>httpd.conf</tt>
      before using OnSearch.

<blockquote><pre>
The following values were found:
The Web site's name is owl.local.net.
The Web site's document directory is /usr/local/apache2/htdocs.
The Web server's version is 2.0.54.
The Web server's directory is /usr/local/apache2.
The Web server's process owner is apache. 
The Web server's port is 8090.
</pre></blockquote>

<li>The install script then verifies the directory where it
should install OnSearch.  Refer to <a
href="#manualinstall">Manual Installation</a> if you want to
install OnSearch elsewhere.

<blockquote><pre>
I'm going to install OnSearch in /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/onsearch.  Is this okay (y/n)?
y
</pre></blockquote>

<li>The install script installs the OnSearch program,
documentation, and libraries, and verifies the location of
the top-level document directory.

<blockquote><pre>
OnSearch will use /usr/local/apache2/htdocs as its top-level document directory.  
Is this okay (y/n)?
y
</pre></blockquote>


<li>The install script then checks for Perl and the GNU C Compiler.
      They must be present or the script will not continue.

<li>The installation script then creates the necessary directories, 
      configures and builds the program files, and sets the
      application's file and directory permissions.
<blockquote><pre>
Creating directories.
Copying files.
Building indexing daemon.
Setting permissions.
</blockquote></pre>

<li>Then the install script asks if you want add directory
wrappers for the OnSearch directories.  They are necessary
to set the correct permissions for OnSearch and enable
passwords for the, <strong>"Admin,"</strong> page.
<p>
<stron>Note:</strong> The installation's administrator user
name is, "onsearch,"  password, "onsearch."  You should
change them to your own user name and password by editing 
<tt>/usr/local/etc/onpasswd</tt> and
<tt>/usr/local/etc/ongroup.</tt>  Refer to the manual page
for Apache's <tt>htpasswd</tt> program for instructions to
set the password.

<blockquote><pre>
I'm going to add OnSearch's configuration to /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf.
I'll copy the original httpd.conf file to httpd.conf.onsearch-save.

You can skip this step, and then configure the Web server
manually, using the template in doc/conf.tmpl.
Should I continue (y/n)?
y

I'm going to add password authentication information to your Web
server configuration and then try to restart the server.

With authentication enabled, users must enter a user name and password
to perform administrative tasks.  For passwords to work the Web server
must include mod_auth in its configuration.

During the process, the installation will copy your old 
/usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf to /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf.onsearch-save, 
so you can restore your previous configuration if necessary.

You can skip this step, but then you will not have password protection
for administrative tasks.

Should I continue (y/n)?
y
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>

.
.
.

Done. If the installation was correct, you should be able to browse to

http://owl.local.net:8090/onsearch/index.shtml

The OnSearch User Guide, 

http://owl.local.net/onsearch/doc/userguide.html

describes how to index files and start using OnSearch.

</pre></blockquote>

<li>You should now be able to browse the URL given by the 
      install script (which uses your Web server's name instead
      of the server given in the example above).  If the Web 
      server's configuration is correct, you should see OnSearch's
      main Web page.  If you encounter an error, refer to 
      <a href="#manualinstall">Manual Installation</a> and 
      <a href="apacheconfig">Configuring Apache</a>.
</ol>
<p>
Refer to the </i>OnSearch User Guide,</i> which you can open
from the, <b>"About,"</b> page for instructions on how to 
configure OnSearch and index documents.

<a name="manualinstall">
<h3>Manual Installation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find the settings of the following variables in the Apache
   <tt>httpd.conf</tt> file.
<blockquote><pre>
ServerName
DocumentRoot
User
</pre></blockquote>

Note: Some Web servers set the site name name using
<tt>Listen</tt> instead of <tt>ServerName.</tt>
<p>
If you can't find <tt>http.conf</tt>, try this command.

<blockquote><pre>
# find / -name "httpd.conf"
</pre></blockquote>

If <tt>find</tt> can't locate the file, then check the Apache 
installation before continuing.

To find the settings mentioned above, either view the file
with a text editor or <tt>more</tt>, or use a shell command
something like this.

<blockquote><pre>
# egrep '^(ServerName|DocumentRoot|User|Listen}' /path/of/httpd.conf
</pre></blockquote>

Substitute the actual path of <tt>httpd.conf</tt> in the example.

<p>
<li>Decide where you want to install
<strong>OnSearch</strong>.  OnSearch's working
   directory should be a subdirectory of <tt>DocumentRoot</tt>, and the
   name of the subdirectory is the value of
   <tt>OnSearchDir</tt> in <tt>onsearch.cfg</tt>, normally <tt>onsearch</tt>.  The
   complete path to the OnSearch directory
   is <tt><i>(DocumentRoot)</i>/onsearch</tt>.

<blockquote>
For example, if <tt>DocumentRoot</tt> is 
<tt>/usr/local/apache/htdocs</tt>, then OnSearch's working
directory will be
<tt>/usr/local/apache/htdocs/onsearch</tt>.  The 
following instructions use this example.
</blockquote>

If you want to install <strong>OnSearch</strong> in a
different subdirectory, open <tt>onsearch.cfg</tt> in a text
editor and edit the value of <tt>OnSearchDir</tt> with the
name of the subdirectory.
<p>
<li>Using a text editor, edit <tt>onsearch.cfg's</tt>
values for <tt>SearchRoot</tt>, <tt>ServerName</tt>, and
<tt>User</tt> with the values you found in step 1.
<p>
<li>Edit <tt>WebLogDir</tt>, <tt>BinDir</tt>, and <tt>DataDir</tt> in
<tt>onsearch.cfg</tt> if you need to change them from the
default <tt>/usr/local/spool/onsearch</tt>, <tt>/usr/local/sbin</tt>, and 
<tt>/usr/local/var/run/onsearch</tt>
<p>
<li>Create the OnSearch directories.
<blockquote><pre>
# mkdir /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch
# mkdir /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/admin
# mkdir /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/cache
# mkdir /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/doc
# mkdir /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/images
# mkdir /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/plugins
# mkdir /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/webpages
# mkdir /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/uploads
# mkdir -p /usr/local/spool/onsearch
# mkdir -p /usr/local/var/run/onsearch
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Copy the Web pages and CGI scripts to OnSearch's working 
directories.
<blockquote><pre>
# cp onsearch.cfg /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch
# cp -R html/* /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch
# cp images/* /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/images
# cp -R cgi/* /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch
# cp doc/* /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/doc
# cp plugins/* /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/plugins
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Set the file and directory ownership and permissions.
<blockquote><pre>
# chown -R nobody /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch
# chown -R nobody /usr/local/spool/onsearch
# chown -R nobody /usr/local/var/run/onsearch
# chmod 0755 /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/*.cgi
# chmod 0755 /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/admin/adminform.cgi
# chmod 0755 /usr/local/htdocs/onsearch/plugins/*
# chmod 0700 /usr/local/var/run/onsearch
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Build and install the Perl libraries.
<blockquote><pre>
# cd lib && (perl Makefile.PL LIB="/usr/local/apache/htdocs/onsearch/lib" && make install)
# make clean
# cd ..
</pre></blockquote>
<p>

<li>Copy <tt>src/Makefile.tmpl</tt> to
<tt>src/Makefile</tt>, and edit <tt>BINDIR</tt> and
<tt>DATADIR</tt> to the <tt>BinDir</tt> and <tt>DataDir</tt>
in <tt>onsearch.cfg.</tt>  Edit the value of
<tt>ONSEARCHDIR</tt> to OnSearch's installation directory.
<p>
Also edit the values of <tt>CC</tt> and <tt>CFLAGS</tt> if
necessary for compilers other than GCC.
<p>
Then build and install onindex.
<blockquote><pre>
# cd src && make install
# make clean
# cd ..
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Copy <tt>doc/Makefile.tmpl</tt> to <tt>doc/Makefile</tt>
and edit <tt>APPDIR</tt> to the directory where
OnSearch is installed, and
<tt>WEBLOGDIR</tt> and <tt>DATADIR</tt> with the values of 
<tt>WebLogDir</tt> and <tt>DataDir</tt> in
<tt>onsearch.cfg</tt>.
<p>
Also edit the <tt>TROFF</tt> variable if necessary.
<p>
Then install the man page for onindex.
<blockquote><pre>
# cd doc && make all
# make clean
# cd ..
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Create the OnSearch authorization files
<tt>onpasswd</tt> and <tt>ongroup.</tt>
<blockquote><pre>
# /usr/local/apache/bin/htpasswd -nb onsearch onsearch >/usr/local/etc/onpasswd
# echo "onsearch: onsearch" >/usr/local/etc/ongroup
</pre></blockquote>
This creates a default administrator user name
<i>onsearch,</i> password <i>onsearch.</i>  You can change
the password, or add users by adding them with
<tt>htpasswd</tt> and adding the users to <tt>ongroup.</tt>
<p>
Refer to the <tt>htpasswd</tt> manual page for further information.
<p>
<li>Edit <tt>doc/conf.tmpl</tt> with the name of OnSearch's
working directory, and add its contents to
<tt>httpd.conf.</tt>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;Directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/onsearch&gt;
    Options ExecCGI Includes
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Edit <tt>doc/auth.tmpl</tt> with the name of OnSearch's
<tt>admin</tt> subdirectory, and add its contents to <tt>httpd.conf.</tt>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;Directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/onsearch/admin&gt;
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName OnSearch
    AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/onpasswd
    AuthGroupFile /usr/local/etc/ongroup
    require group onsearch
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</ol>
<p>
Refer to the <i>OnSearch User Guide,</i> which you can open
from the, <b>"About,"</b> page, for information about
configuring OnSearch and indexing documents.

<h4>Perl Configuration</h4>

<h5>Unicode Support</h5>

OnSearch's HTML filtering relies on Unicode support which was
first built into Perl in version 5.6.1.  If you have an
earlier version of Perl, change the <tt>Plugin</tt> entries in
<tt>onsearch.cfg</tt> for the <tt>text/html</tt> and
<tt>text/xml</tt> MIME types from, <tt>plugins/html,</tt>
to, <tt>plugins/text.</tt> You will be able to index
HTML and XML documents, but OnSearch will not recognize 
international characters.

<h5>Perl I/O Abstraction Layer</h5>

In some early releases of Perl version 5.8, OnSearch's
background processing causes increased memory usage and
reduced search times if Perl is configured with the I/O
abstraction layer.  If you can not upgrade Perl, the
following workarounds help avoid the abstraction layer
incompatibilities.
<p>
To determine if Perl uses the I/O abstraction layer, use
the following shell command.

<blockquote><pre>
# perl -V | grep 'useperlio'
</pre></blockquote>

 The value of, <tt>"useperlio,"</tt> should be,
 <tt>"undef."</tt>

If the value is, <tt>"define,"</tt> then you can get Perl to
use normal (Unix) I/O with either of the following methods.

<ul>
<li>Set the <tt>PERLIO</tt> environment variable to use the
I/O protocol you want.  For OnSearch, the value, <tt>":unix,"</tt>
seems to provide the most efficiency. 
<p>
To do this, add the following line to <tt>httpd.conf,</tt>
outside of any directory wrappers.

<blockquote><pre>
SetEnv PERLIO :unix
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This workaround assumes that Apache was build with
<tt>mod_env.</tt>  You can verify this by typing at 
the shell prompt:
<blockquote><pre>
# <i>/path-to-httpd</i>/httpd -l
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The <tt>perlrun(1)</tt>
manual page describes the <tt>PERLIO</tt> options.

<li>Or&mdash;as a more reliable solution&mdash;you 
can build Perl without the I/O abstraction
layer.  

<blockquote><pre>
sh Configure -Uuseperlio -des
</blockquote></pre>

Then build and install Perl as usual.

</ul>

<a name="apacheinstall">
<h4>Apache Installation</h4>

<a name="apache13install">
<h5>Apache 1.3</h5>

This section describes how to build and install Apache 1.3.19 from the
source code distribution, from 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org</a>, and configure it
to work with <strong>OnSearch</strong>.
<p>
Following the instructions in <tt>README.configure</tt>,
build and install Apache with support for the
standard modules and Dynamic Shared Object support, and
install the server in <tt>/usr/local/apache</tt>:
<blockquote><pre>
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
> --enable-module=most \
> --enable-shared=max
# make
# make install
</pre></blockquote>

<tt>README.configure</tt> also describes many other configurations.
To use <strong>OnSearch</strong>, you must enable at least
<tt>mod_cgi</tt>, <tt>mod_auth</tt>, and <tt>mod_include</tt>.
Building them should be enabled by default, but this example 
shows how to enable them explicitly.

<blockquote><pre>
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
> --enable-module=cgi \
> --enable-module=include \
> --enable-module=auth
# make
# make install
</pre></blockquote>
Start the Apache server:
<blockquote><pre>
# /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start
</pre></blockquote>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> This configuration omits many
standard features and is recommended only if you plan 
to use the Web server with OnSearch.
<p>
If Apache is working correctly, you can view the manual at the
following URL:
<blockquote>
http://<i>&lt;your-host-name&gt;</i>/manual/
</blockquote>

You should then be able to view the Apache home page at the following
URL:
<blockquote>
http://<i>&lt;your-host-name&gt;</i>/
</blockquote>

<a name="apache2install">
<h5>Apache 2.0</h5>

OnSearch can use the default installation of Apache versions
2.0.<i>x</i>.  To build and install the Web server, use the
following shell commands.

<blockquote><pre>
# ./configure
# make
# make install
</pre></blockquote>

Then edit the <tt>Listen</tt> and <tt>ServerName</tt> lines
as described in <tt>httpd.conf</tt>, and start the
server.  

<blockquote><pre>
# /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
</pre></blockquote>

Browsing to the Web server's address should display
the Apache default home page.
<p>
The section, <a href="#apache20config">Apache 2.0 Configuration</a>,
describes configuring the Web server for OnSearch.

<a name="apacheconfig">
<h4>Configuring Apache</h4>

<strong>Note:</strong> In all versions of Apache, it may be
necessary to add a unique user and group ID for the Web
server, in order index from within OnSearch. You will also need to
<tt>adduser</tt> and <tt>addgroup</tt> (or <tt>useradd</tt>
and <tt>groupadd</tt>) the Web server's unique user and group.

<a name="apache13config">
<h5>Apache 1.3</h4>

Configuring Apache requires several steps:
<ol>
<li>Determine that the Web server has loaded the necessary modules.
<li>Enable the handlers for CGI scripts and server side
includes.
<li>Add the permissions that OnSearch needs.
<li>Create the password and group files.
<li>Restart the Server.
</ol>

<a name="loadmodules">
<h5>Load Modules</h5>

If you installed Apache with the configuration described in 
<a href="#apacheinstall">Apache Installation</a>, you will
need to load modules by using <tt>LoadModule</tt> statements
in <tt>httpd.conf,</tt> as described below.

However, if the Web server does not have Dynamic Shared
Object support enabled, you can determine which modules are
already loaded with the following shell command.

<blockquote><pre>
# /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd -l
Compiled-in modules:
  http_core.c
  mod_env.c
  mod_log_config.c
  mod_mime.c
  mod_negotiation.c
  mod_status.c
  mod_include.c
  mod_autoindex.c
  mod_dir.c
  mod_cgi.c
  mod_asis.c
  mod_imap.c
  mod_actions.c
  mod_userdir.c
  mod_alias.c
  mod_access.c
  mod_auth.c
  mod_setenvif.c
suexec: disabled; invalid wrapper /usr/local/apache/bin/suexec
</pre></blockquote>

The modules that OnSearch needs are: <tt>mod_cgi,</tt>
<tt>mod_include,</tt> and <tt>mod_auth.</tt> If any of these
are not compiled into the Web server, you'll need to load
them dynamically by adding the following lines to
<tt>httpd.conf</tt> if they are not already present.

<blockquote><pre>
LoadModule auth_module /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_auth.so
LoadModule cgi_module /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_cgi.so
LoadModule includes_module /usr/local/apache/libexec/mod_include.so
</pre></blockquote>

The file paths in the examples are those of a standard
Apache directory layout used in <a
href="#apacheinstall">Apache Installation</a>.  You may need
to adjust the paths depending on the Web server's
configuration.
<p>
If any of these modules are missing, consult
<tt>INSTALL</tt> in the Apache source code archive.

<a name="enablehandlers">
<h5>Enable Handlers</h5>

To enable the handlers for CGI scripts and server side
includes, uncomment the relevant lines in
<tt>httpd.conf.</tt>
<p>
Change the lines:
<blockquote><pre>
    #AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
    .
    .
    .
    #AddType text/html .shtml
    #AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
</pre></blockquote>
So that they look like the following:
<blockquote><pre>
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
    .
    .
    .
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
</pre></blockquote>

<a name="addpermissions">
<h5>Add Permissions</h5>
The easiest way to add permissions for OnSearch is to add the
following sections to <tt>httpd.conf.</tt>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;Directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/onsearch&gt;
    Options ExecCGI Includes
    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
This template is contained in the file
<tt>doc/conf.tmpl.</tt> 
You must edit the <tt>&lt;Directory ...&gt;</tt> line with
the name of the directory where OnSearch is installed.
<p>
You can also add these options for the entire Web site.  The 
comments in <tt>http.conf</tt> and the Apache manual provide
further information.
<p>
The following section configures the OnSearch admin
page to use passwords.
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;Directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/onsearch/admin&gt;
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName OnSearch
    AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/onpasswd
    AuthGroupFile /usr/local/etc/ongroup
    require group onsearch
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
This template is contained in the file
<tt>doc/auth.tmpl</tt>.  It must be added in this format if
you want to use passwords with OnSearch.
Again, you must edit the
<tt>&lt;Directory...&gt;</tt> line with the name of the
OnSearch <tt>admin</tt> subdirectory.

<a name="createpasswdfile">
<h5>Create <tt>onpasswd</tt> and <tt>ongroup</tt> Files</h5>

This step requires the <tt>htpasswd</tt> utility, which
should be installed with the Apache server (in
<tt>/usr/local/apache/bin</tt> in these examples).
<p>
The <tt>install</tt> script creates <tt>onpasswd</tt> with
the user name, "onsearch," password, "onsearch," but you can
select any user name and password you like.

To create the <tt>onpasswd</tt> file, use the following
shell command.
<blockquote><pre>
# htpasswd -nb onsearch onsearch >/usr/local/etc/onpasswd
</pre></blockquote>
Create the <tt>ongroup</tt> file with the following command.
<blockquote><pre>
# echo 'onsearch: onsearch' > /usr/local/etc/ongroup
</pre></blockquote>
To change the user name or password, or add and delete
users, consult the Apache documentation.

<a name="restartserver">
<h5>Restart the Server</h5>

The final step is to restart the server.
<blockquote><pre>
# /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart
</pre></blockquote>

<a name="apache20config">
<h5>Apache 2.0 Configuration</h5>

Install Apache as described in <a
href="#apache2install">Apache Installation</a>, and make certain
the Web server is operating correctly.
<p>
Then uncomment the following lines in <tt>httpd.conf</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

AddType text/html .shtml
AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml
</pre></blockquote>

Also add <tt>doc/auth.tmpl</tt> and <tt>doc/conf.tmpl</tt>
to </tt>httpd.conf</tt> and create the password and group
files as described in the <a href="#apache13install">Apache
1.3</tt> installation section.
