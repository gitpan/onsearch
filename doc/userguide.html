<h3>Starting <font class="onsearch">OnSearch</font></h3>
You can browse to the <font class="onsearch">OnSearch</font>
search page by entering the following URL in your World Wide
Web browser.
<blockquote>
http://<i>server-name</i>/onsearch/index.shtml
</blockquote>
You need to substitute <i>server-name</i> with the name of
the Web server where <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> is installed.

<a name="searching">
<h3>Searches</h3> 
Figure 1 shows the <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> search page.
From this page,
you can enter search terms, define options for the search,
and begin searching.
<p>
<center>
<img src="searchpage.jpg" alt="OnSearch Search Page">
<p>
Figure 1.  The <font class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> search page.
</center>
<a name="searchingtext">
<p>
Enter the search terms, and click on, "Search."  Search
terms are words composed of letters, numbers, and
underscores ('_').  
<p>
The phrase, "To be, or not to be," for example, is treated as 
six separate words: "To," "be," "or," "not," "to," "be."  
<p>
Similarly, a technical term like, "Tk::MainWindow," the name
of a Perl library module, is treated as two words: "Tk," and
"MainWindow."
<p>
The search options determine whether <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font>
searches for documents that contain any or all of the search
terms, or the exact phrase.  <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> can match documents that
contain words of the exact case of the search terms, or
search for matches without regard for case.  It can also 
search for partial word matches. For example, "be" can 
also match, "best," and, "not," can match, "knot."  
<p>
<h4>Speeding Up Searches</h4> 
Exact search terms allow <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> to perform its searches
more quickly.  Searches for documents that contain exact
phrases like, "To be, or not to be," or, "X Window System,"
require only slightly more time than searches for single words.
<p>
Selecting, "Match text within words," causes searches to
take much longer than exact word searches.  The inexact
terms match more words in each document, the process of
determining each inexact match takes longer, and OnSearch
has more results to handle.
<p>
Searches for words consisting of a single letter, when you
have selected the option, "Match text within words," are the
least efficient of all search types.  In these cases, <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> matches documents with
<i>every</i> indexed word that contains the letter.
<p>
Later searches, however, require
less time if the results are already cached.
<p>
<h4>Search Preferences</h4> <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> records search
preferences, including the type of match, whether to match
both upper and lower case letters, text within words, the
number of matching terms to display from each document, and
the number of documents to display on each page of results.
<p>
<font class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> also records if
users have selected a specific volume or volumes (see, 
<a href="#volumes">Volumes</a>), and preferences for 
indexing Web pages from other sites.
<p>
The Web browser
must allow cookies from the OnSearch Web site in order to
record the search information.
<p>
Once <font class="OnSearch">OnSearch</font> begins
searching, it displays the first page of
matching documents as soon as they are retrieved.  The next
section, <a href="#viewing">Viewing Results,</a> describes
how to view matching documents.

You can page backward and forward through the results by
clicking on the page numbers at the top and bottom of the
page.  The total number of documents matched is the total
found by a search in progress and could change as you
view the results.

<a name="adding">
<h3>Adding Files and Web Pages To Be Searched</h3>
Clicking <strong>"Archive"</strong> on the menu takes you to
the Archive page, as in Figure 3, where you can upload
documents or retrieve individual Web pages or the pages of 
Web sites to be indexed and then searched by <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch.</font>
<p>
<center>
<img src="indexpage.jpg" alt="OnSearch Archive Page">
<p>
Figure 3.  The archive upload and indexing page.
</center>
<p>
<i>Adding Web pages.</i>  You can upload either a single Web
page or all of the Web pages from another site.  When you click on, 
"Update," <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> 
sends
the request to the Web indexer, which begins to process your
request as a background task, and then returns to the
Archive page.
<p>
The pages are searchable as soon as <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> has indexed them.
<p>
<font class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> is able to handle URL
redirection and content negotiation. So, for example, to retrieve
the English language home page of a site that offers
multiple languages, it's possible to enter just the
Web server name without the <tt>index.html.</tt>  The
other Web server should send the actual English language page,
which will be archived by <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> as, for example,
<tt>index.html.en.</tt>
<p>
<font class="OnSearch">OnSearch</font> does not retrieve Web
pages that are on Web servers different than the Web server
you entered, unless the <font
class="OnSearch">OnSearch</font>administrator enables that
capability.  Nor does it index Web pages that the remote site
requested to be excluded from indexing.
<p>
<font class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> records the 
progress of the Web page retrieval process in its Web log
if the administrator enables this option.
<p>
<i>Uploading files.</i> When uploading files, <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> opens a file selection
dialog.  Choose the file to upload.  Then, click on,
"Update," and <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> processes the request in
the background.
<p>
The file will be searchable and viewable as
soon as <font class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> indexes
it.
<p>
<font class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> can index document types
other that text and HTML.  For example, if the administrator
has enabled filters for Postscript and PDF documents, you
can upload documents of those types also to be searched and 
retrieved.  See, <a href="#admin">"OnSearch
Administration,"</a> or consult with the system administrator.

<div class="footer">
<a href="#contents">Return to the Table of Contents.</a>
</div>

<a name="volumes">
<h3>Volume Filters</h3>

Without any further configuration, OnSearch searches all of
the documents on your Web site, and the name of the search
volume, "Default," is visible on the Search page.  However,
if the administrator has configured alternate search volumes
for the site, you can select which parts of the Web site you 
want to search.
<p>
For example, if the Web site's technical documentation is in
a subdirectory called, <tt>"docs,"</tt> the administrator
can create a volume called, "Documentation," that specifies
this subdirectory.  When searching, if you select only the
volume, "Documentation," OnSearch searches only those
documents.
<p>
OnSearch records your volume preferences.  Like other
preferences, your Web browser must allow cookies from the
OnSearch Web site for OnSearch to save your personal data.

</ol>

<a name="indexing">
<h4>Indexing</h4>

The <tt>onindex</tt> program performs the work of indexing
the Web site's documents.  <tt>Onindex</tt> runs as a
background process, and indexes files at the interval given
by <tt>IndexInterval</tt> in <tt>onsearch.cfg,</tt> normally
every four hours.
<p>
<tt>Onindex</tt> indexes only those directories that have
been updated since the previous indexing task.  Although
the first time that you index a Web site might take minutes or
even hours for a large site, later indexing is much faster.
<p>
Before indexing, make sure that you have edited
<tt>onsearch.cfg</tt> with the <tt>ExcludeDir</tt> and
<tt>ExcludeGlob</tt> values that will prevent onindex 
from indexing anything that you don't need indexed, like 
PHP and Java library files, or OnSearch's cache directory.
See <a href="#onsearchcfg"><tt>onsearch.cfg</tt>
Configuration.</a> 
<p>
OnSearch does not run <tt>onindex</tt> automatically.  You
can start it from the <strong>Admin</strong> page by
checking the, "Index Now," box, or as the system
administrator from the command line using either of these 
shell commands.

<blockquote><pre>
# /usr/local/sbin/onindex
# /usr/local/etc/init.d/onindex start
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If <tt>onindex</tt> is idle, the system administrator can start indexing
immediately with the following shell command.

<blockquote><pre>
# /usr/local/etc/init.d/onindex index
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To stop <tt>onindex</tt>, the system administrator can use
the following command.

<blockquote><pre>
# /usr/local/etc/init.d/onindex stop
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<tt>Onindex</tt> records its activity in the 
<a href="#logging">OnSearch Web log.</a>  For testing or 
monitoring, the administrator can tell 
<tt>onindex</tt> to provide more detailed information with
the following shell commands.

<blockquote><pre>
# /usr/local/sbin/onindex -v
</pre></blockquote>
Or,
<blockquote><pre>
# /usr/local/sbin/onindex -vv
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> To run <tt>onindex</tt> from the,
<strong>"Admin,"</strong> page, the Web server must have its
own unique user and group ID, for example, user
<tt>apache,</tt> group, <tt>apache,</tt> in order for the
program to have the necessary permissions to start as a
background process.

<p>
The <tt>onindex(8)</tt> manual page contains detailed
information about <tt>onindex</tt> options and run-time
files.  
<div class="footer">
<a href="#admin">Return to the Administration Table of Contents.</a>
</div>

<a name="docperms">
<h4>Document Permissions</h4>
<tt>Onindex</tt> writes indexes in each document's
directory.  In order to do this, it is necessary that the
site's documents and document directories be writable by
the Web server.
<p>
The Web server's <tt>httpd.conf</tt> file contains the user
and group information as the values of the, <tt>"User,"</tt>
and, <tt>"Group,",</tt> directives.  
<p>
The system administrator needs to set the site's document permissions to
these values.  Initially the following shell commands change
the ownership of the Web site's documents and document
directories, assuming the administrator has configured the
Web server to run as user, <tt>apache,</tt> group, <tt>apache.</tt>

<blockquote><pre>
# chown -R apache /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
# chgrp -R apache /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
</pre></blockquote>

<strong>Note:</strong> Giving the Web server the ability to
write to the document directories can be a security risk.
The Apache manual document,
<tt>manual/misc/security_tips.xml</tt> discusses these
issues.

<div class="footer">
<a href="#admin">Return to the Administration Table of Contents.</a>
</div>

<a name="logging">
<h4>The OnSearch Web Log</h4> OnSearch and <tt>onindex</tt>
record their activity, and any warnings or errors, in their
Web log, which is normally
<tt>/usr/local/spool/onsearch/onsearch.log.</tt> The log
uses a format similar to Apache's default Common Log Format,
so you can parse the log for information as you would one of
Apache's logs.

<p>
OnSearch's administrator can configure OnSearch and
<tt>onindex</tt> to log extra information about local and
remote indexing activity, and caching.
<tt>Onsearch.cfg</tt> contains these options, which are
described in <a href="#onsearchcfg"><tt>OnSearch.cfg</tt>
Configuration.</a>

<p>
The system administrator can rotate the OnSearch log with the
<tt>rotatelogs(8)</tt> utility that is distributed with the
Apache server.

<div class="footer">
<a href="#admin">Return to the Administration Table of Contents.</a>
</div>

<a name="adminuser">
<h4>Administrator User IDs and Passwords</h4>
In a normal installation, OnSearch maintains its
administrator user IDs, passwords, and groups in the
following files.

<blockquote><pre>
/usr/local/etc/onpasswd
/usr/local/etc/ongroup
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Refer to the <tt>htpasswd(8)</tt> manual page for
information about adding users and passwords, and to the 
Apache documentation for <tt>mod_auth</tt> for information
about configuring authorization with Apache.

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>  The installation user name of the
OnSearch administrator is, "onsearch," password, "onsearch."
You should change these values after installation.

<div class="footer">
<a href="#admin">Return to the Administration Table of Contents.</a>
</div>

<a name="backupindexes">
<h5><tt>BackupIndexes</tt></h5>
If this value is non-zero, OnSearch makes backup copies of
the indexes.

<a name="bindir">
<h5><tt>BinDir</tt></h5>
This is the directory where <tt>onindex</tt> is located.
Its value is normally <tt>/usr/local/sbin.</tt>

<a name="cacheresults">
<h5><tt>CacheResults</tt></h5>
If non-zero, OnSearch caches the results of each search.
This option should be enabled for normal use.  Caching
should only be disabled when testing OnSearch.

<a name="cachereports">
<h5><tt>CacheReports</tt></h5>
If set to a non-zero value, <tt>CacheReports</tt> logs extra
information about cache activity.

<a name="datadir">
<h5><tt>DataDir</tt></h5>
This is the directory where OnSearch and <tt>onindex</tt>
store their run time information.  In OnSearch's normal
configuration, its value is <tt>/usr/local/var/run/onsearch.</tt>

<a name="digitsonly">
<h5><tt>DigitsOnly</tt></h5>
This option, if non-zero, tells <tt>onindex</tt> to also
index words that contain only digits.

<a name="excludedir">
<h5><tt>ExcludeDir</tt></h5>
The value of each <tt>ExcludeDir</tt> entry is a directory that you
don't want to be indexed or searched.  <tt>Onsearch.cfg</tt>
can have as many <tt>ExcludeDir</tt> entries as necessary.  
<p>
At the least, you should exclude OnSearch's cache directory
from searching, as in this example.

<blockquote><pre>
ExcludeDir /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/onsearch/cache
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you add or delete <tt>ExcludeDir</tt> entries, the index
contents could become invalid, and you should
reindex the site.  The <tt>onindex(8)</tt> manual page
describes how to delete old indexes.

<a name="excludeglob">
<h5><tt>ExcludeGlob</tt></h5> 
The value of each <tt>ExcludeGlob</tt>
directive is a wild-card pattern. <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> excludes files with 
names that match the entry's pattern from indexing and searching.

<p>
For example, because GIF image files contain no text,
<font class="onsearch">OnSearch</font> excludes them with 
the following entries.

<blockquote><pre>
ExcludeGlob *.gif
ExcludeGlob *.GIF
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If the operating system distinguishes between upper and
lower case file names, you should include
<tt>ExcludeGlob</tt> entries for both.

<p>
OnSearch's normal configuration excludes Postscript and PDF
documents from indexing and searching, because it can
significantly slow the search process.  If you want to index
and search documents of these types, comment out or remove
these <tt>ExcludeGlob</tt> entries, as in the following example.

<blockquote><pre>
# ExcludeGlob  *.ps
# ExcludeGlob  *.PS
# ExcludeGlob  *.pdf
# ExludeGlob   *.PDF
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You can also determine which files <font
class="onsearch">OnSearch</font>
indexes and searches based on the files' MIME types.
See <a href="#plugin"><tt>PlugIn.</tt></a>

<p>
After adding or deleting <tt>ExcludeGlob</tt> entries, the
index contents are invalid, and it is necessary to
re-index the site.  The <tt>onindex(8)</tt> manual page
contains instructions for deleting old indexes.

<a name="hassymlinks">
<h5><tt>HasSymLinks</tt></h5>
Set this value to non-zero if the operating system provides
symlinks.  It should not be necessary to change this value.

<a name="indexinterval">
<h5><tt>IndexInterval</tt></h5>
The interval, in seconds between the times that
<tt>onindex</tt> reindexes the files and directories that
have changed.  In a normal configuration, its value is
14400 seconds, or four hours.

<a name="indexnontargeturls">
<h5><tt>IndexNontargetURLs</tt></h5>
If set to non-zero OnSearch also indexes remote site URLs that are
linked to by the site being indexed.

<p>
<strong>Warning:</strong> You should use this option with
extreme caution, because the Web indexer can retrieve many
more Web pages (and Web sites) than the site the user requested.

<a name="onsearchdir">
<h5><tt>OnSearchDir</tt></h5>
The value of <tt>OnSearchDir</tt> is the name of the
subdirectory where OnSearch is installed.  It is normally a
subdirectory of the Web server's <tt>DocumentRoot</tt>
directory, as in this example.

<blockquote><pre>
OnSearchDir /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/onsearch
</pre></blockquote>

<p>In normal use, you should not need to change this value.

<a name="pagesize">
<h5><tt>PageSize</tt></h5>
The default number of documents to display on each page of
results.  This value is normally saved as a user preference.

<a name="partialwordmatch">
<h5><tt>PartialWordMatch</tt></h5>
This is the default value of the, "Partial Word Match,"
search option, which is saved as a user preference.

<a name="plugin">
<h5><tt>PlugIn</tt></h5>
Each <tt>PlugIn</tt> entry defines a plugin filter for a
MIME type that filters the text for that file type.

<p>
Plugins are filter programs that run helper applications,
like <i>xpdf,</i> <i>ghostscript,</i> and <i>gzip</i>,
reading the document to be indexed as standard input and
writing the searchable text to standard output.

<p>
Plugins are located in the <tt>plugins</tt> subdirectory of 
<tt>OnSearchDir.</tt>

<p>
OnSearch includes plugins for the following MIME types.
<ul>
<li><tt>text/plain</tt>
<li><tt>text/html</tt>
<li><tt>application/postscript</tt>
<li><tt>application/pdf</tt>
<li><tt>image/jpeg</tt>
</ul> 

<p>
Each <tt>PlugIn</tt> entry contains the MIME type of the
document and the name of the plugin.  If a file does not
contain text, or you don't want to index a certain file
type, you can specify the <tt>null</tt> plugin as the second
argument.  

<p>
You can also exclude document types from searching based on
their file extension.  See <a href="#excludeglob"><tt>ExcludeGlob.</tt></a>

<p>
After adding or deleting <tt>PlugIn</tt> entries, the
index contents could become invalid, and you should
reindex the site.  The <tt>onindex(8)</tt> manual page
contains instructions for deleting old indexes.

<a name="resultsperfile">
<h5><tt>ResultsPerFile</tt></h5>
This is the default value of the, "Results per file," user
option, which is saved as a user preference.

<a name="resultspersist">
<h5><tt>ResultsPersist</tt></h5>
The value is the amount of time, in seconds, that OnSearch
keeps search results.

<a name="searchcontext">
<h5><tt>SearchContext</tt></h5>
The value is the number of characters to display on either
side of a matched word or phrase.

<a name="searchroot">
<h5><tt>SearchRoot</tt></h5>
If there is only one <tt>SearchRoot</tt> entry, its value is normally 
the Web server's document directory, the
value of <tt>DocumentRoot</tt> in <tt>httpd.conf</tt>.

<p>
If the administrator has not configured any volumes, it is
also the value of the volume, "Default."  See <a
href="#volume">Volume.</a>

<p>
You can change this value to a subdirectory of
<tt>DocumentRoot,</tt> if necessary, to limit searching to
only a part of the site.  In that case, you should also add
<tt>SearchRoot</tt> entries for <font class="onsearch">
OnSearch's</font> <tt>websites</tt> and <tt>uploads</tt>
subdirectories.

<a name="servername">
<h5><tt>ServerName</tt></h5> The fully qualified domain name
of the Web server, or its numeric IP address.  The value is
the same as the value of <tt>ServerName</tt> in
<tt>httpd.conf.</tt>

<a name="singleletterwords">
<h5><tt>SingleLetterWords</tt></h5>
If set to non-zero, this option instructs <tt>onindex</tt> to also index
single letter words.

<p>
You should leave this option enabled, because OnSearch uses
several sets of rules to try to avoid retrieving, for
example, every instance of the letter, "x," or, "c," when
searching, for example, for, "X Window System," and "C
Language."

<a name="user">
<h5><tt>User</tt></h5>
The user name of the Web server process owner.  This is the same
as the value of <tt>User</tt> in <tt>httpd.conf</tt>

<a name="verbosewebindexer">
<h5><tt>VerboseWebIndexer</tt></h5>
If the value is non-zero, OnSearch records information about
individual URLs that users have requested to be retrieved
and indexed. 

<p>
<tt>VerboseWebIndexer</tt> also enables the logging of HTTP
redirects and content negotiation, and notes URLs that are
disallowed from retrieval.

<a name="volume">
<h5><tt>Volume</tt></h5>
The value of each <tt>Volume</tt> entry is the label of a
volume and the subdirectory of the Web site that the entry refers
to.  

<p>
If the administrator has not configured any volumes, the
volume, "Default," refers to the <tt>SearchRoot</tt>
directory.

<p>
OnSearch saves users' volume selections as part of his or her preferences.

<a name="weblogdir">
<h5><tt>WebLogDir</tt></h5>
The value is the subdirectory where OnSearch keeps its Web
log.  Its value is normally <tt>/usr/local/spool/onsearch.</tt>
