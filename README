OnSearch README

The Perl script, "install," builds and configures OnSearch based on
the site's Apache Web server configuration.  The following command
should install OnSearch.

 # perl install

INSTALL.html contains detailed installation instructions, including
system requirements and manual installation procedures.  

After installation, the User Guide's administration chapter,
doc/userguide.html#admin, and the onindex(8) manual page, describe
how to administer OnSearch and index documents.
